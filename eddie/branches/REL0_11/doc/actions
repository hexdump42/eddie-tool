email( "<recipient>[|<recipient>...]", "<subject>", <body> )
email( "<recipient>[|<recipient>...]", <body> )
    Sends an email to recipient (or list of recipients seperated by '|'.  If
    there are three arguments supplied, the 2nd argument is a string containing
    the subject, and the third argument is either a string containing the
    body of the message, or a reference to an 'M' definition (except that the
    subject defined by the 'M' definition would be overridden by the subject
    given as argument 2).
    If only two arguments are supplied, the second argument is either a string
    containing the body of the message (where a default built-in subject would
    be used) or a reference to an 'M' definition.
    Relevant Directives: ALL


system( "<cmd>" )
    Will execute the command as given with a call to Python system() function.
    If the return value is not 0, an Alert is logged.
    Relevant Directives: ALL


restart( "<name>" )
    Performs a system command, calling an init script with the 'start' argument
    specified.  For example, restart( "testd" ) would cause the execute
    command to be: "/etc/init.d/testd start".
    Relevant Directives: ALL


nice( <val> )
nice( <incr>, <val> )
    Changes the nice value of the process.
    If one argument supplied, it is the new absolute priority level.
    If two arguments supplied, the first is the positive or negative
    incrementor (ie: '+' or '-') and the second is the relative offset to be
    added to (or subtracted from) the priority level.
    Relevant Directives: D, PC, PID


eddielog( "<text>" )
eddielog( "<text>", <loglevel> )

                  HOW TO ADD AN ACTION
                  ====================

New actions are setup in action.py as follows:
1.  Create a new function for the action, where the function _must_ be
    exactly the same as the action name (and take the same arguments).
    This is because the action function call will be exactly the same as
    what is supplied in the config file.  If the specified action function
    does not exist, an error is raised.  eg: a config line that looks like:
	D  megad        NR      restart('mega')
    would cause the action function call to be "restart('mega')".

    The function should perform any statements necessary to complete the
    action.

2.  Add an explanation of the new action to doc/actions.
