Here is a syntax file for vim that I use, which helps when editing. Hopefully
other people might find it useful too.

To use it you can either ':set filetype=eddie' when you are within vim, or
include the following in your ~/.vim/filetype.vim file:

        augroup filetypedetect
        au BufNewFile,BufRead /opt/eddie/config/*.rules set filetype=eddie
        au BufNewFile,BufRead /opt/eddie/config/eddie.cf set filetype=eddie
        augroup END
