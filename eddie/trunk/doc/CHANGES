Eddie CHANGES
(reverse chronological order)

Eddie-0.28 (9-Mar-2002)
 - Cleaned up df code, added data caching and made thread-safe, like other
   data collectors.
 - Fixed up eddie_wrapper locating GNU date on Solaris.
 - Fixed memory-leak in disk-usage code (reported by Dougal Scott
   <dwagon@connect.com.au>).
 - Exit with error if all threads are locked (cannot kill threads in current
   Python implementation).
   Make eddie_wrapper a little smarter when restarting eddie process.
 - Added example init.d scripts to contrib for Solaris and Redhat Linux.
 - Added another vmstat parser to get free memory/swap information for
   Solaris.
 - Added a common semaphore for utils.safe_popen()/safe_pclose() and
   utils.safe_getstatusoutput() to use between them.  It appears that
   system calls, of any sort - system() calls, popen(), commands module,
   etc - are not thread-safe and cannot be performed simultaneously by
   multiple threads at once.  This should prevent such race-conditions as
   all EDDIE system calls use these functions.
 - Cleaned up access to the system stats cache so that only one thread at a
   time will be refreshing the data.
 - Added some more smarts to eddie_wrapper:
   - don't start Eddie if one is already running.
   - don't restart Eddie more than a set number of times in a short period of
     time (requires GNU date command).
 - Put semaphore lock around Elvin notify to ensure thread-safe notifications
   are being sent.  Suspect duplicates were being sent before.
 - Now logs the current thread name for each log entry for improved debugging.
 - A lot of cleaning up of system.py for Solaris.
   Added all counter stats from 'vmstat -s'.
   Changed gathering of loadavg/uptime stats from '/usr/bin/uptime' rather than
   '/opt/local/bin/top' - trying to phase out use of 'top'.
   Improved documentation at top of class, with listing of every stats variable
   available from the system class.
 - Added prtdiag parsing for Enterprise class servers (E3500,E6500,etc)
   for temperature.
 - Added support for prtdiag for Sun U280R's.
 - Added list of paths to find metastat command for Solaris METASTAT directive.
 - Added PRTDIAG directive to provide an interface to the system-specific
   data provided by prtdiag on Sun machines.
   Currently only system temperatures are extracted for U450s and U250s.
 - Added support for VxFS filesystems in df.py for Solaris.
 - Updated docs to require Python versions 1.6+

Eddie-0.27 (12-Nov-2001)
 - Put semaphore lock around Elvin connect calls to prevent multiple threads
   trying to connect at once.
 - Fixed bug with ELVINURL and ELVINSCOPE config options not being set
   properly.
 - Socket errors in Console code are matched with errno error names, rather
   than assuming the error numbers are the same across platforms.
   [Bug reported by: Ivar Zarans <iff@alcaron.ee>]
 - Handle socket errors from PINGs nicely.
 - Added a reconnect() function to force the elvin connection closed before
   reconnecting.
 - Cleaned up eddieElvin4 code, including connecting and auto-reconnecting to
   Elvin server when connection is lost.
 - Added better exception handling for "Connection Timed Out" error in PORT
   directive isalive() function.
 - Fixed file descriptor leak in PORT directive isalive() function when
   Connection Refused exception is handled the socket file descriptor was
   not being closed.
 - Added more system statistics to the Linux system data collector module.
   Added most of the stats available from /proc/stat, including:
     cpu_user      - total cpu in user space
     cpu_nice      - total cpu in user nice space
     cpu_system    - total cpu in system space
     cpu_idle      - total cpu in idle thread
     cpu%d_user    - per cpu in user space (e.g., cpu0, cpu1, etc)
     cpu%d_nice    - per cpu in user nice space (e.g., cpu0, cpu1, etc)
     cpu%d_system  - per cpu in system space (e.g., cpu0, cpu1, etc)
     cpu%d_idle    - per cpu in idle thread (e.g., cpu0, cpu1, etc)
     pages_in      - pages read in
     pages_out     - pages written out
     pages_swapin  - swap pages read in
     pages_swapout - swap pages written out
     interrupts    - number of interrupts received
     contextswitches - number of context switches
     boottime      - time of boot (epoch)
     processes     - number of processes started (I think?)
   These are now available to directives like SYS.
 - Cleaned up eddie-adm email headers.

Eddie-0.26 (1-Oct-2001)
 - Changed elvinrrd() action call arguments slightly.  It is now:
   elvinrrd( 'rrdkey', 'arg1=val1', 'arg2=val2', ... )
   The first argument must be the RRD database name to store data into.
   All arguments following that (one or more) are "variable=data" strings
   where variable is the name of the variable in the RRD db and data is
   the data to store in that variable.  RRD dbs can have multiple variables
   so this allows some or all of them to be updated in one action call.
 - Wrapped the critical calls in safe_popen(), safe_pclose() and
   safe_getstatusoutput() in try/except clauses, so that any exceptions are
   intercepted and the semaphore locks are released (exceptions are then
   raised again to be handled as normal).  This stops threads being blocked
   on semaphore acquires which used up the thread pool quickly and was
   obviously bad.
 - Added elvinrrd action which is used to send data samples over Elvin to a
   consumer which stores that data into an RRD database.
 - Updated elvindb() action and elvindb() Elvin function to support Elvin4.
   elvindb actions are now working again.
 - Directive states now transition from "ok" to "failinitial" to "fail".
   "ok" indicates the directive is fine;
   "failinitial" indicates the directive is current transitioning to the "fail"
    state or is waiting on a re-check;
   "fail" indicates the directive has definitely failed.
 - Fixed a small bug where a directive performing multiple checks (numchecks>1)
   which fails one of the first checks but passes a subsequent re-check still
   performs the act2ok action, which it should not do.
 - Directive threads are named, for easier debugging.  The name they are given
   is the ID of the directive they are executing.
 - Cleaned up ALIAS code to support being passed in action calls properly.
 - Cleaned up action calling code.  Actions called from action and act2ok now
   use the same action evaluation function, whether actions are called
   directly as a function or from Notification objects.  Thus actions can be
   called directly or Notification objects used from both action and act2ok
   arguments, and can even be combined.
 - Added a rule argument to RADIUS directive so rules can be written to test
   radius auths.  The variable passed is set in the rule environment and is
   set to either 0 for failed or 1 for passed.
 - FILE directive now makes the file statistics from the previous check
   available so rules can compare the current statistics against the previous
   statistics to see if files or file metadata have changed over time.
   Variables are same but prepended by 'last', e.g.: rule='md5 != lastmd5'
 - Fixed bug: Connection not being closed in all cases for PORT isalive()
   function.
 - Added new directive, FILE, allowing tests to be made on a file based on
   standard file statistics (size, mode, ownerships, etc) and md5 hashes.
 - Update lastfailtime in stateok function so any actions called by act2ok
   will know the full age of the problem.
 - Added PING directive to provide network ping checking of hosts.
 - Added initial HP-UX support.
 - Fixed bug in PROC R() check.


Eddie-0.25 (6-Jul-2001)
 - Changed where varDict action variables are set in some directives so that
   they are available for act2ok action calls.
 - Improved error handling in directive.py
 - Fixed problem with DF list not refreshing itself properly.
 - Changed CONSPORT config option to CONSOLE_PORT.
   I find more verbose to be much user-friendlier than less.
 - Added two new config settings:
    EMAIL_FROM='emailaddress'
    EMAIL_REPLYTO='emailaddress'
   so the From: and Reply-To: fields in the email action can be set.
   If these are not set, they default to the current USER for the From: field,
   and '' for the Reply-To: field.
 - Cleaned up PORT directive isalive() handling Connection Refused exceptions.
 - Create a QUICKSTART text document to give the impatient a quick way to
   get Eddie running.
 - sockets.py: handle port already in use by exiting and signalling the other
   non-daemon threads to exit.  If the port is in use the whole program should
   exit cleanly with an appropriate error message now.
   Similarly, exit cleanly (and signal other threads to exit) if too many
   socket errors.
 - config.py: Improved error handling; if CONSPORT is not a positive integer a
   ParseFailure is raised.
 - The console server thread will not be started if CONSPORT=0.  This allows
   the console feature to be disabled if required.
 - Main thread will now also exit if please_die Event is set.  This allows
   other threads to signal that the program should exit.
 - Added act2ok param - allows you to specify a Notification object
   to use when Check goes from bad to good
 - Log accepted connections with remote IP:port, for security or whatever.
 - directive.py: made directive string representation tidier.
 - sockets.py: Handle "Interrupted system call" (from CTRL-C) nicely.
 - Chaged eddie.py - changes include cleaning up the way threads
   are started and stoped, there is now start_threads() and
   stop_threads().  I did this so that both the scheduler thread
   and the console socket thread can be started and stop easily
   when the config changes.
 - Added config var CONSPORT - this is the port to listen to
   console connections on.  The default is 33343.
 - Added sockets.py - A sockets interface to the current state of
   all eddie checks, this will be used for a console like interface.
 - Removed DEFs and replaced by ALIASes which are now used to define string
   aliases to be substituted during config parsing, or during action argument
   parsing.  '$' signs are not used anymore, giving a much nicer Python
   look-and-feel.
 - Added %(problemage)s %(problemfirstdetect)s to sample MSGs to demonstrate
   usage.  These are substituted for the age of the current directing being
   false and the time the first false was detected respectively; or empty
   strings ("") if the problem age is currently 0.
 - Added more detailed logging of thread usage, making thread problems easier
   to track.
 - Added a utils.safe_getstatusoutput() as a thread-safe wrapper around
   commands.getstatusoutput().
   The IPF directive now uses this to avoid deadlocks.
 - Problem age and First time detected variables are now substitutable values
   within an email message body, %(problemage)s and %(problemfirstdetect)s,
   instead of automatically being appended to the bottom of every email.
   Note, these variables are empty ("") if the problem age is zero.
 - Changed all os.popen() calls to use the thread-safe utils.safe_popen().
   This should prevent deadlocks when multiple directives are gathering info.
 - Added 'negate' option to LOGSCAN - will match lines which do NOT match the
   regex.
 - Added formatted exception traceback to safeCheck() logging.
 - Fixed socket connect() call in pop3.py to support Python 2.1
 - Email admin logs when exiting due to config parse failure.
 - Added LOGSCAN examples.
 - Updated sample rules to reflect new config layout and features.
 - Log Eddie version and systype.
   Also log when configuration parsing complete.
 - Cleaned up pop3.py imports.
 - Added LOGSCAN directive for monitoring logfiles.
 - Fixed PROC custom rules setting.
 - Fixed directives setting their own ID only if none set in config.
 - parseFailure() logs problem to logfile as well as printing to stdout.
 - Cleaned up sample eddie.cf and added verbose comments.
 - Catch any uncaught exceptions around main() so they are logged and displayed
   nicely, making it easier for the Eddie admin to see and act on them.
   Hence eddie doesn't have to be run from eddie_wrapper with stderr captured
   (which didn't really work properly anyway).
 - Fixed socket connect() call in PORT directive to use tuple as argument
   rather than two arguments.  This changed in Python-2.1 (but works with
   older versions).
 - Removed the old snpp code which wasn't being used.  This should be replaced
   with updated code.
 - Elvin config parameters have changed from ELVINHOST and ELVINPORT to
   ELVINURL and ELVINSCOPE to support Elvin4 properly.
 - The Elvin tickertape action is now called ticker() [it was just called
   elvin() before].
 - Updated Elvin code to support Elvin4 and moved to new file eddieElvin4.py.
   Elvin3 will no longer be supported.
 - Replaced any use of old regex module with new re module (using regex causes
   warnings with Python-2.1).
 - Tested under Python-2.1.  Had to modify some of the globals to avoid new
   warnings under 2.1.
 - Updated system.py to handle 'top' under Solaris 8.
 - Directive threads are started with safeCheck() which wraps up docheck()
   in try/except so all un-caught exceptions within that thread will be caught
   and the thread can exit cleanly.
 - Cleaned up parsing of 'top' a bit more, so it works better under Solaris 8.
 - Added support for directive templates.  A directive can be created to be
   only used as a template for other directives, supplying default settings;
   as well as standard directives can also be used as templates for other
   directives.
   Directive template creation, eg:
       PROC 'template1':   template=self   scanperiod='5m' checks=2 checkwait=30
       PROC 'cron':        template='template1'    procname='crond' action="..."
  special template=self means this directive is a template and not to
  schedule it.
  Can use other working directives as templates also.
  Template should be same directive type as directive using it - but this is
  not enforced because it shouldn't hurt.... directives ignore any arguments
  they don't need.
 - Added support for new Directive arguments:
    numchecks=<int>
    checkwait=<time>
   numchecks specifies how many checks a directive should perform before
   calling its actions.  By default this will be 1.  Setting this to 2
   will force 2 checks before actions are called.  It can be set to any
   positive integer, include 0.  0 is a special case which indicates that
   this directive will not perform any checks.  This could be used to
   temporarily disabled a directive, for example.
   checkwait specifies how long the directive will wait before performing
   its next re-check if numchecks>1.  Its value is a standard time specification
   eg: '5' = 5 seconds; '5s' = 5 seconds; '2m' = 2 minutes; '5h' = 5 hours.
   By default checkwait is 0 which means the next re-check will run instantly.
   checkwait should normally be set to a meaningful value if numchecks>1.
 - Added ALIAS definition.  Similar to DEFs but ALIASes are replaced inside
   action calls, etc.  Whereas DEFs are only translated during config file
   parsing time.
   Note: DEFs break the Python-like look&feel of the config file and may
   disappear in the future if they can be replaced neatly.
 - Cleaned up logging in config.py.  LOGFILE should be the first option
   in eddie.cf so logs end up in the right place.
 - Handle scanperiod argument in directives so scanperiod can be overrided
   for each directive.
 - Signals received during a time.sleep() under Linux cause an IOError
   exception so just catch these and move on.  Main thread should be
   handling the shutdown cleanly anyway.
 - Cleaned up directive tokenparsing so base Directive class does as
   much of the work as possible and user-written directive objects
   only have to test existance of arguments and setup.
 - New config format, which is not compatable with old format.
   All arguments to a directive are now named arguments.
 - Max number of threads to use can be limited in eddie.cf with the
   NUMTHREADS variable now.  Should be set > 5 for normal use.
   If set too low checks will never be allowed to run.
 - Created Radius auth checking directive.
 - Added clean exiting code to SIGINT, same as SIGTERM.
 - Cleaned up exiting on SIGTERM signal.  The scheduler thread is signalled to
   die and the main thread will wait for the scheduler thread to receive the
   signal and exit before exiting cleanly itself.  All "worker" threads are
   ignored and should die of their own accord.
 - Put semaphores around COM checks which do os.system() calls.
   Only one COM check will execute at a time.
 - Made proc.py thread-friendly.
 - timeQueue is the queueing class derived from Python's Queue class.  It is as
   thread-friendly as Queue, the major difference being objects are inserted
   into the queue based on a given time.  Objects with the lowest times are
   closest to the front of the queue.
   To support this, objects have to be added along with their time, so a
   2-tuple must be added, eg: q.put( (obj, time) ).  Similarly q.get()
   returns the same 2-tuple.
   An extra public method has been added, over what Queue offers, q.head().
   This method returns the item (and time) from the front of the queue,
   exactly as q.get(), but does not remove it from the queue.
 - To support the new queueing of jobs, all directives must end by submitting
   themselves back into the queue.  A
   Config.q.put(self,time.time()+self.scanperiod) will submit itself back
   into the queue and schedule itself to be run in self.scanperiod seconds.
   If a directive does not put itself back into the queue it will not be
   called again (this can be useful if there is some sort of error and the
   directive should not be called again).
 - os.popen() appears to cause problems when used by multiple threads at once,
   so all such calls now use a wrapper, utils.safe_popen() which performs
   a semaphore lock around os.popen().  utils.safe_pclose() _MUST_ be called
   after the pipe has been finished with or the semaphore will not be released
   and all other calls will be blocked forever.
 - Core of Eddie is now multi-threaded using a scheduler thread to run each
   check in its own thread.  Thread usage is limited so things don't get out
   of control.
   The scheduler tracks jobs with a derivative of Python's Queue class which
   orders items by time, so that the job to be started soonest will be at the
   front of the queue.  This will now allow directives to specify their own
   scanperiod and execute as often or as little as desired, indepentently of
   other directives.
   Modified config files are still automatically detected (sometime within a 10
   minute period by the "Housecleaning" thread (main process)) which causes the
   scheduler to be signalled to exit and then the configs are re-read and a new
   scheduler will be started up.


Eddie-0.24 (1-Oct-2000)
 - Added custom disksuite check to alert if any metadevices require
   maintenance.  Skips checking if /usr/opt/SUNWmd/sbin/metastat not found.
 - Separate system.py for Solaris 5.8 because of differences.
 - Better logging of problem states for debugging.  Problem states track
   the current "state" of a problem (ok, failed, etc), and the time when
   the problem was first detected.
 - Email action now includes the age of the problem and when the problem was
   first detected (if not the first time) in the email.
 - Added handler for when pop3 connections are failing or not authing.
 - Fixed bug with parsing config when indentations are incorrect.
   Handles it better now by raising a ParseFailure exception and pointing
   out the error line in the config file.
 - Changed string variable substitution method from %variable to Python's
   format %(variable)s.  This lets us use Python's built-in variable
   substitution on strings and makes the implementation much simpler.
 - Log parsing failures in parseVars()
 - Fixed small bug with pop3 error checking.


Eddie-0.23 (19-Jun-2000)
 - cleaned up Solaris x86 support (still fairly untested).
 - changed Linux system.py to get statistics from /proc rather than
   parsing 'top' output.
 - added close() method to kstat object and removed kstat_close() call
   from kstat object initialization function which was possibly causing
   seg faults in solkstatmodule.so.
 - elvindb() action now takes optional string argument containing the
   column/value pairs to store in the database (via Elvin).
 - added POP3TIMING directive for checking and timing pop3 connections
   in new pop3 directive module.
 - added CRON directive for cron checks in solaris.py directive module.
 - added IPF directive for ipfilter tests.
 - added support for custom Directive imports from new Directive directory.
 - added count of filedescriptors for debugging.
 - fixed bug with PROC check which would only perform check on first
   process found with the name specified.  It now performs checks on every
   process with the specified name.
 - added a kstat_close() to fix a file-descriptor leak in solkstatmodule.so.
 - added a default class, DataStore, for storage subclasses to use, which
   automatically caches data.
 - added support for iostat data to STORE directive.
 - find OS-specific modules in multiple directories from most specific
   to least specific (eg: OS/version/architecture, OS/version, then OS).
 - changed auto system type determination to internal code rather than
   calling separate 3rd-party 'systype' script.
 - added iostat objects for collecting iostat data under Solaris.  Uses
   a shared library, solkstatmodule.so, created by the Eddie developers
   and included.


Eddie-0.22 (15-May-2000)
 - added defaults for out and err in COM directive to stop an exception
   when the executed command did not write stdout or stderr files.
 - fixed SIGALRM so it works properly under Linux.  (Works slightly
   differently to Solaris).
 - COM did not use the return value of a os.system() call properly.  This
   has been fixed as per the wait (2) call.
 - email() action takes an optional 3rd argument which is the body of
   the message.  Otherwise the 2nd argument is used as both subject and body.
 - msg is copied to subject for simple email() call with only subject given.
 - changed import for new Elvin.py module.
 - now using Python 1.5.2
 - fixed process name hash keys.
 - added Solaris x86 support.
 - added Linux support (tested with RedHat 6).


Eddie-0.21 (4-Oct-1999)
 - catch timeouts while trying to stat config files and skip the config file
   modified checks.
 - added '-n' to 'netstat -i' coz resolving interfaces on some hosts were
   taking forever.
 - fixed Elvin messaging with new ElvinConnection object.
 - added Elvin db data-storage consumer daemon.
 - separated Solaris 2.5 and 2.7-specific lib areas.
 - added caching functionality to data gathering code.
 - added functions to return hashes of network information.
 - changed eddie-elvin interface to maintain single shared connection to Elvin
   server.
 - added double-checking for SP directive.
 - added STORE directive to enable configuration of data to be sent via
   elvindb().
 - added elvindb() functionality to send database objects over Elvin to
   database consumer.
 - added support for Solaris 2.7.
 - created sample config files in config.sample.
 - fixed quote problem with address specified in SP check.
 - PORT directive handles multiple lines sent to destination.
 - added estored development to contrib area.
 - added creation of system objects for collecting system stats.
 - added SYS directive to allow detailed checks to be performed on system
   data such as load-average, memory/swap usage, cpu idle %, etc.
 - parses email address strings for variable definitions.
 - fixed int overflow errors in netstat data collection.
 - elvin() will use subject as message if message is blank for Tickertape.
 - fixed small bug with actions parsing '%' at end of line.
 - added directive 'NET' to allow detailed checks on current network
   statistics.
 - netstat object now obtains all current network statistics from host
   (ie: 'netstat -s') under Solaris.
 - added 'IF' directive to enable detailed network interface checks.
 - added new rule for process checking to allow complex checks to be performed
   on running processes.
 - automatically re-load config files if any have changed.
 - during process (and pid) checks, if process isn't found, sleep a bit then
   double check.
 - now only pulls in process info when called, and caches that info for a
   set time before fetching it again.
 - now pulls in every bit of process info that ps can provide.
 - added a wrapper for eddie to capture major exceptions and auto restart.
