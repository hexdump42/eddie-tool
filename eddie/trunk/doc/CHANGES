Eddie CHANGES

Eddie-0.24 (1-Oct-2000)
 - Added custom disksuite check to alert if any metadevices require
   maintenance.  Skips checking if /usr/opt/SUNWmd/sbin/metastat not found.
 - Separate system.py for Solaris 5.8 because of differences.
 - Better logging of problem states for debugging.  Problem states track
   the current "state" of a problem (ok, failed, etc), and the time when
   the problem was first detected.
 - Email action now includes the age of the problem and when the problem was
   first detected (if not the first time) in the email.
 - Added handler for when pop3 connections are failing or not authing.
 - Fixed bug with parsing config when indentations are incorrect.
   Handles it better now by raising a ParseFailure exception and pointing
   out the error line in the config file.
 - Changed string variable substitution method from %variable to Python's
   format %(variable)s.  This lets us use Python's built-in variable
   substitution on strings and makes the implementation much simpler.
 - Log parsing failures in parseVars()
 - Fixed small bug with pop3 error checking.


Eddie-0.23 (19-Jun-2000)
 - cleaned up Solaris x86 support (still fairly untested).
 - changed Linux system.py to get statistics from /proc rather than
   parsing 'top' output.
 - added close() method to kstat object and removed kstat_close() call
   from kstat object initialization function which was possibly causing
   seg faults in solkstatmodule.so.
 - elvindb() action now takes optional string argument containing the
   column/value pairs to store in the database (via Elvin).
 - added POP3TIMING directive for checking and timing pop3 connections
   in new pop3 directive module.
 - added CRON directive for cron checks in solaris.py directive module.
 - added IPF directive for ipfilter tests.
 - added support for custom Directive imports from new Directive directory.
 - added count of filedescriptors for debugging.
 - fixed bug with PROC check which would only perform check on first
   process found with the name specified.  It now performs checks on every
   process with the specified name.
 - added a kstat_close() to fix a file-descriptor leak in solkstatmodule.so.
 - added a default class, DataStore, for storage subclasses to use, which
   automatically caches data.
 - added support for iostat data to STORE directive.
 - find OS-specific modules in multiple directories from most specific
   to least specific (eg: OS/version/architecture, OS/version, then OS).
 - changed auto system type determination to internal code rather than
   calling separate 3rd-party 'systype' script.
 - added iostat objects for collecting iostat data under Solaris.  Uses
   a shared library, solkstatmodule.so, created by the Eddie developers
   and included.


Eddie-0.22 (15-May-2000)
 - added defaults for out and err in COM directive to stop an exception
   when the executed command did not write stdout or stderr files.
 - fixed SIGALRM so it works properly under Linux.  (Works slightly
   differently to Solaris).
 - COM did not use the return value of a os.system() call properly.  This
   has been fixed as per the wait (2) call.
 - email() action takes an optional 3rd argument which is the body of
   the message.  Otherwise the 2nd argument is used as both subject and body.
 - msg is copied to subject for simple email() call with only subject given.
 - changed import for new Elvin.py module.
 - now using Python 1.5.2
 - fixed process name hash keys.
 - added Solaris x86 support.
 - added Linux support (tested with RedHat 6).


Eddie-0.21 (4-Oct-1999)
 - catch timeouts while trying to stat config files and skip the config file
   modified checks.
 - added '-n' to 'netstat -i' coz resolving interfaces on some hosts were
   taking forever.
 - fixed Elvin messaging with new ElvinConnection object.
 - added Elvin db data-storage consumer daemon.
 - separated Solaris 2.5 and 2.7-specific lib areas.
 - added caching functionality to data gathering code.
 - added functions to return hashes of network information.
 - changed eddie-elvin interface to maintain single shared connection to Elvin
   server.
 - added double-checking for SP directive.
 - added STORE directive to enable configuration of data to be sent via
   elvindb().
 - added elvindb() functionality to send database objects over Elvin to
   database consumer.
 - added support for Solaris 2.7.
 - created sample config files in config.sample.
 - fixed quote problem with address specified in SP check.
 - PORT directive handles multiple lines sent to destination.
 - added estored development to contrib area.
 - added creation of system objects for collecting system stats.
 - added SYS directive to allow detailed checks to be performed on system
   data such as load-average, memory/swap usage, cpu idle %, etc.
 - parses email address strings for variable definitions.
 - fixed int overflow errors in netstat data collection.
 - elvin() will use subject as message if message is blank for Tickertape.
 - fixed small bug with actions parsing '%' at end of line.
 - added directive 'NET' to allow detailed checks on current network
   statistics.
 - netstat object now obtains all current network statistics from host
   (ie: 'netstat -s') under Solaris.
 - added 'IF' directive to enable detailed network interface checks.
 - added new rule for process checking to allow complex checks to be performed
   on running processes.
 - automatically re-load config files if any have changed.
 - during process (and pid) checks, if process isn't found, sleep a bit then
   double check.
 - now only pulls in process info when called, and caches that info for a
   set time before fetching it again.
 - now pulls in every bit of process info that ps can provide.
 - added a wrapper for eddie to capture major exceptions and auto restart.
