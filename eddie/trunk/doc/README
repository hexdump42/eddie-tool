This is Eddie.

It is still very much in development but is working in its current
form and has been working for 4 years (it is the primary monitoring
and alerting tool at the author's places of employment).

Documentation is online at http://www.codefx.com.au/eddie/doc/

You need to create a config directory where config.sample is located
and create an eddie.cf config file and rules files.  See config.sample
for examples.

See QUICKSTART if you are impatient.

See http://www.codefx.com.au/eddie/ for more information.
