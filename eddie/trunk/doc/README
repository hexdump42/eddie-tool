This is the EDDIE Tool.  It is a monitoring, security and performance
analysis tool for most common flavours of UNIX.

It is still very much in development but is very stable in its current
form and has been used in production for over 4 years (it is the primary
monitoring tool at the author's places of employment).

Documentation is online at http://eddie-tool.net/doc/ and in the doc/
directory of the EDDIE-Tool distribution.

You need to create a config directory where config.sample is located
and create an eddie.cf config file and rules files.  See config.sample
for examples.

See QUICKSTART if you are impatient.

See http://eddie-tool.net/ for more information.
Email eddie@eddie-tool.net for information/help/tips/comments/etc.
