This is the EDDIE Tool.  It is a monitoring, security and performance
analysis tool for most common operating systems.

It is still being continuously developed but is very stable in its current
form and has been used in production for over 5 years (it is the primary
monitoring tool at the author's places of employment, for example).

Documentation is online at http://eddie-tool.psychofx.com/doc/ and in the doc
directory of the EDDIE-Tool distribution.

You need to create a config directory where config.sample is located
and create an eddie.cf config file and rules files.  See config.sample
for examples.

See QUICKSTART.txt if you are impatient.

See README.win32.txt if you are installing on Win32 (Windows XP or
Server).

See README.OpenBSD.txt if you are installing on OpenBSD.

See LICENSE.txt for licensing details.

See http://eddie-tool.psychofx.com/ for more information.
