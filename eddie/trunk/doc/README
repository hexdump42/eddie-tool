This is the EDDIE Tool.  It is a monitoring, security and performance
analysis tool for most common flavours of UNIX.

It is still being continuously developed but is very stable in its current
form and has been used in production for over 5 years (it is the primary
monitoring tool at the author's places of employment, for example).

Documentation is online at http://eddie-tool.net/doc/ and in the doc/
directory of the EDDIE-Tool distribution.

You need to create a config directory where config.sample is located
and create an eddie.cf config file and rules files.  See config.sample
for examples.

See QUICKSTART if you are impatient.

See http://eddie-tool.net/ for more information.
Email info at eddie-tool dot net for information/help/tips/comments/etc
or join one of the mailing lists.  The authors will be only too happy
to assist.

Cheers,
Chris & Rod.
