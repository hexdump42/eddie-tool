This is Eddie.

It is still very much in development but is working in its current
form and has been working for 3 years (it is our primary monitoring
and alerting tool at Connect).

Documentation is online at http://www.codefx.com.au/eddie/doc/

You need to create a config directory where config.sample is located
and create an eddie.cf config file and rules files.  See config.sample
for examples.

See http://www.codefx.com.au/eddie/ for more information.
