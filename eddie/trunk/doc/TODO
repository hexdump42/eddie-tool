Things TODO for Eddie!

y Multi-threaded checks
y Add NUMTHREADS as a config variable
y Change directive syntax to be "DIRECTIVE 'name': etc etc"
y Add scanperiod argument to directives

- Double checking for Port directive - or ALL directives with keyword

- rule dependencies

- make os-dependent data collectors thread-safe, as Linux/proc.py

- Fix doArgs to use standard Python args.

- Problem age/ack details variable for messages, eg: %(probage)s, etc.

- Fix history object.

- TEST with 'import elvin' (Elvin4)

- escalation

- logfile checking

- ping checks

- radius checks

- msg objects in action calls, eg:
    PORT  'hostname': 50006   ""  "ALIVE" email('alert', commonmsg.port.WARN)

- store disk usage in eddiedb

- check inode usage

- FILE checks (like tripwire) - stat file, and md5 file.
- Similarly, DIR checks, like "DIR /usr/bin" to notify of changes.

- Can store state between sessions (for FILE checks, history, etc).
  Store state to /var/run/eddie/.... which can be re-read if restarted.

- "cron" mode for directives: always tries to run jobs starting from specific
  intervals, rather than pausing for interval between runs.


BUGS:
 - Unknown directives are not handled properly.
 - Directives spanning multiple lines not parsed properly.

 - core dumps from iostat/kstat library sometimes...
