EDDIE TODO

- df.py: df list needs to cache properly like other data collectors...

- rule dependencies

- make os-dependent data collectors thread-safe, as Linux/proc.py

- Fix doArgs to use standard Python args.

- Fix history object.

- escalation

- msg objects in action calls, eg:
    PORT  'hostname': 50006   ""  "ALIVE" email('alert', commonmsg.port.WARN)

- store disk usage in eddiedb

- check inode usage

- DIR checks, like "DIR /usr/bin" to notify of changes.

- Can store state between sessions (for FILE checks, history, etc).
  Store state to /var/run/eddie/.... which can be re-read if restarted.

- "cron" mode for directives: always tries to run jobs starting from specific
  intervals, rather than pausing for interval between runs.

- group should handle multiple hostnames, eg: "group myeah,myponga:"

- PROC rule NR/R, change to variable, ie: rule="!exists"

- back off on warnings - something like 10m, 30m, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, etc.

- allow MSG strings to be included from separate files, so instead of a string
  in the MSG def, it would have file:procwarn.

- add excludehosts argument to directives, to provide a list of hostnames
  to not execute this directive on.

- extra args for PROC: matchre='.*': match on regular expression
    user="username": match on user
    notuser="username": match not owned by user, and allow multiple entries
    allow userid matches in rule.

BUGS:
 - Unknown directives are not handled properly.

 - cannot have a commented line in the middle of a directive definition...

 - needs a catch in SIGHUP to catch the interupted system call - severity minor [RT]
