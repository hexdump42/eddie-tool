Things TODO for Eddie!

y Multi-threaded checks
y Add NUMTHREADS as a config variable
y Change directive syntax to be "DIRECTIVE 'name': etc etc"
y Add scanperiod argument to directives
y Add ALIAS definition type for action argument aliases, etc

- Double checking for directives: use arguments checks= and checkwait= eg:
  crond': checks=2 checkwait=30 procname='crond' rule='NR' action="..."
  means perform 2 checks total (only perform the second check if the
  first one fails) and wait 30seconds between checks.
  The directive is actually re-scheduled in the scheduler queue for 30seconds
  time.

- Directive template creation, eg:
    PROC 'template1':	template=self	scanperiod='5m'	checks=2	checkwait=30
    PROC 'cron':	template='template1'	procname='crond'	action="..."
  special template=self means this directive is a template and not to
  schedule it.
  Can use other working directives as templates also.
  Template must be same directive type as directive using it.

- rule dependencies

- make os-dependent data collectors thread-safe, as Linux/proc.py

- Fix doArgs to use standard Python args.

- Problem age/ack details variable for messages, eg: %(probage)s, etc.

- Fix history object.

- TEST with 'import elvin' (Elvin4)

- escalation

- logfile checking

- ping checks

- radius checks

- msg objects in action calls, eg:
    PORT  'hostname': 50006   ""  "ALIVE" email('alert', commonmsg.port.WARN)

- store disk usage in eddiedb

- check inode usage

- FILE checks (like tripwire) - stat file, and md5 file.
- Similarly, DIR checks, like "DIR /usr/bin" to notify of changes.

- Can store state between sessions (for FILE checks, history, etc).
  Store state to /var/run/eddie/.... which can be re-read if restarted.

- "cron" mode for directives: always tries to run jobs starting from specific
  intervals, rather than pausing for interval between runs.

- group should handle multiple hostnames, eg: "group myeah,myponga:"

- PROC rule NR/R, change to variable, ie: rule="!exists"


BUGS:
 - Unknown directives are not handled properly.
 - Directives spanning multiple lines not parsed properly.

 - core dumps from iostat/kstat library sometimes...
