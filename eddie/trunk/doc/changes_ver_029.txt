Major Eddie Config Changes for version 0.29+
--------------------------------------------
Chris Miles <chris@psychofx.com>


Some major changes to the EDDIE-Tool configuration were made for version
0.29.  If you are running an earlier version and wish to upgrade to 0.29
or newer you will need to make changes to your configuration as documented
below.


- The major changes are:
  - all directives now require a 'rule' argument.  Although some directives
    have a default rule set, so for those you don't have to specify a rule.
  - action variables have lost the directive prefix, so now all the action
    variables match the rule variables for consistency.
  - some of the arguments have changed names so they are more intuitive.
  - some of the variables have changed names for the same reason.
  - action arguments do not need quotes around the action calls anymore
    (although should still work with them).


- some of the specific changes to directives are listed below (but not
  all, see config.sample or the User's Manual for examples and more
  information)
