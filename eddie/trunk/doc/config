                  Config Options
                  ==============

INCLUDE <filename>
      -	the file <filename> will be parsed before returning to the current
       	config file.  The path is assumed to be relative to the directory
	where the current config file is located.  This allows each
	directive configuration to be in a different file.
	Note that <filename> must be enclosed by single (') or double (")
	quotes.

LOGFILE <logfile>
      -	the file where Eddie will write standard log messages.  Note that
       	<logfile> must be enclosed by single (') or double (") quotes.

LOGLEVEL <loglevel>
      -	the amount of detail Eddie will log (to <logfile>).  The levels
       	are defined as follows:
		0 - no logging at all
		1 - log serious problems - problems which may crash program
		2 - log important errors - which may cause incorrect operation
		3 - log alerts - do not affect program operation, but aren't good
		4 - log warnings - don't affect anything but should be noted
		5 - log actions taken and above
		6 - log informative messages and above
		7 - ??
		8 - log most things except multi-line crap - good for debugging
		9 - log EVERYTHING! - use with caution!
	Each set level will cause logging of itself and all log levels less
	than it, eg: level 3 will cause everything described in levels
	0, 1, 2 and 3 to be logged.
	Note: some levels have not yet been defined!

SCANPERIOD <time>[s|m|h|d|w|c|y]
      -	approximate minimum scan period.  <time> is in seconds unless
	specified by an appended character as follows:
		s - seconds
		m - minutes
		h - hours
		d - days
		w - weeks
		c - calendar months
		y - years
	Eddie will actually sleep for <time> seconds between each check
	which means that the full interval between checks will be greater
	than <time> [ie: <eddie execution time>+<time>].


                  HOW TO ADD A CONFIG
                  ===================

New config options are setup in config.py as follows:
1.  Create a new class for the config option, preferably with the classname
    the same as the option name.  It should be a derived class of
    ConfigOption.  It should call the default __init__ function of
    ConfigOption as the first command in its __init__ function.
    It should setup a regexp which will find the command in a string
    (assume comments have been stripped).  It should then call
    self.parseRaw() which will return the value of the option and
    set this value to a global variable.

    The following template should probably be used:

	## NEWOPTION - a template for a new config option		**
	class NEWOPTION(ConfigOption):					**
    	def __init__( self, *arg ):
	    apply( ConfigOption.__init__, (self,) + arg )
	    self.regexp = 'NEWOPTION[\t ]+\([a-zA-Z0-9]+\)[\t \n]*'	**
	    value = self.parseRaw()
	    global newoption						**
	    newoption = value		# set the config option		**

    The lines with ** at the end need to be modified.

2.  Add the config command to the dictionary of directives located at
    the bottom of the file, with the command in quotes (") followed by
    the classname of the command.  eg:

		"NEWOPTION"	: NEWOPTION,			\
	
3.  Add an explanation of the new config option to doc/config.
