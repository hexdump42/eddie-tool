Requirements:

 o Python 2+
   http://www.python.org/

 o The above module requires RRDtool
   http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

 o py-rrdtool - to generate graphical images from RRD files using Python.
   This is part of the RRDtool distribution, but if need be it can be found
   at http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-rrdtool/
   or http://www.nongnu.org/py-rrdtool/

 o A web server (eddiebrowser.cgi is a CGI program!)


Optional Requirements:

 o ElvinRRD - for storing data in RRD databases over a network.
   http://www.psychofx.com/elvinrrd/

 o Elvin - ElvinRRD uses the Elvin messaging software.
   http://elvin.dstc.edu.au/

 o The EDDIE Tool - can be used for gathering system/network stats and
   sending these to RRD files using ElvinRRD & Elvin.
   http://eddie-tool.net/

 o Any other data collector / RRD software.


INFORMATION

 eddiebrowser is used to browse and display data stored in
 RRD database files.  It does not write or create RRD databases.
 To do this use EDDIE Tool/Elvin/ElvinRRD or many of the other
 data collection and RRD packages available.

 eddiebrowser is part of the EDDIE Tool project.  Contact the
 EDDIE Tool team for more assistance.  http://eddie-tool.net/


INSTALLATION

 eddiebrowser expects a certain directory structure which is
 simple to create, and allows eddiebrowser to automatically
 pick up new hosts and data types to display.

 Start by creating a directory for all the data, let's call
 it /export/rrd
    $ mkdir /export/rrd
 In this directory create subdirectories for each of the data
 types.  Your data collector/RRD writer package may do this
 automatically for you (ElvinRRD does).
    $ mkdir /export/rrd/cpulinux
 Write the RRD files for this data type to this directory.
 Hostname details can be stored in the filename, allowing
 eddiebrowser to easily find the RRD files for specific
 hosts.

 Example:
    $ ls -l /export/rrd/cpulinux/
    -rwxrwxrwx  1 cmiles  users   139188 Jun 22 16:36 cpulinux-crazy.rrd

 This shows the RRD database file, cpulinux-crazy.rrd, for
 'cpulinux' data for host 'crazy'.

 eddiebrowser needs to know how to display the data.  The config files
 specify the fields, colours and labels to use for graphing each
 type of RRD data.

 The config file used is chosen by the name of the directory (aka data
 type name) appended with ".cfg" from the configs directory.  For
 the example above the config file would be: configs/cpulinux.cfg 

 Many example config files are provided which can be used out-of-the-box
 with the Eddie Tool/ElvinRRD setup.  Alternatively you can customise
 and create your own.
