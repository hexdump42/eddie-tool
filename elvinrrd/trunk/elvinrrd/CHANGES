ElvinRRD CHANGES
(reverse chronological order)

ElvinRRD-2.3 (04-Dec-2005)
- Added cpubsd-* for FreeBSD cpu stats.
- Added various entries for storing Win32 system data: cpuwinnt-*
  winints-* cpuwin-* wincs-* winsyscalls-* winprocs-* winthreads-*.
- Bugfix: SystemExit exceptions are now ignored by the global exception
  catcher.
- Various tidying up of comments and docstrings.


ElvinRRD-2.2 (30-Nov-2004)
 - Added many more config entries to elvinrrd.cf.
 - Changed the Python RRDtool module it uses.  The old one, PyRRDtool, seems
   to have disappeared off the face of the earth.
 - Now uses py-rrdtool from http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-rrdtool/
   or http://www.nongnu.org/py-rrdtool/
 - Added uncaught exception handler to log any critical exceptions before
   exiting.
 - Cleaned up some of the docstrings/comments.
 - Cleaned up a few log() calls (removed extra '\n').


ElvinRRD-2.1a (1-Nov-2001)
 - Fixed support for multiple store keys.  Multiple store keys must be
   separated by ',' (no spaces).  All keys must be found in the Elvin message,
   and all will be updated in the RRD at once.
 - Added full command-line argument support.
 - Cleaned up logging - can define different logging levels (minimal, verbose,
   debug) and optionally log to a logfile.
 - Updated elvinrrd.cf sample configuration file with new config format.
 - Added a create argument so RRD files are automatically created if they do
   not already exist.
 - Changed config format, allowing wildcards to be supplied in the elvinrrd
   key which can be substituted in the rrdfile, store and create arguments if
   required.


ElvinRRD-1.0 (5-Sep-2001)
 - Initial test version of elvinrrd.
