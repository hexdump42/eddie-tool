ElvinRRD CHANGES
(reverse chronological order)

ElvinRRD-2.1a (1-Nov-2001)
 - Fixed support for multiple store keys.  Multiple store keys must be
   separated by ',' (no spaces).  All keys must be found in the Elvin message,
   and all will be updated in the RRD at once.
 - Added full command-line argument support.
 - Cleaned up logging - can define different logging levels (minimal, verbose,
   debug) and optionally log to a logfile.
 - Updated elvinrrd.cf sample configuration file with new config format.
 - Added a create argument so RRD files are automatically created if they do
   not already exist.
 - Changed config format, allowing wildcards to be supplied in the elvinrrd
   key which can be substituted in the rrdfile, store and create arguments if
   required.


ElvinRRD-1.0 (5-Sep-2001)
 - Initial test version of elvinrrd.
