!EddieTool comes from:

 http://eddie-tool.net/



A quickstart tutorial is available at:

 http://eddie-tool.googlecode.com/svn/eddie/trunk/doc/QUICKSTART.txt



The basic path is:

download, unpack, install a basic config and run eddie/bin/eddie.py



It is worth noting, that once your config tree is setup on one server, you can simply copy the whole eddie

tree to other servers. With this in mind, when you are crafting your rulesets, if a rule will only work on say

Linux, and you will be running on linux and solaris, consider using classes to define your hosts.



A suggested basic config is shown below, and should work on any unix/linux.

It checks the following:

 / is under 90% full -> email if fails check

 /etc/passwd hasn't changed -> email if fails check





1) put correct path to python in eddie/bin/eddie.py

2) edit these lines in eddie/config/eddie.cf to reflect your details

{{{

ADMIN="eddie_admins@mydomain.com"

EMAIL_FROM='eddietool@mydomain.com'

EMAIL_REPLYTO='eddietool@mydomain.com'

SMTP_SERVERS='mail.mydomain.com'

ALIAS ALERT_EMAIL="eddie_alert@mydomain.com"

ALIAS ONCALL_EMAIL="eddie_pager@mydomain.com"

}}}

2.2) comment out any lines beginning with "CLASS"



2.3) use these INCLUDE rules

{{{
INCLUDE 'rules/message.rules'   # common MSG definitions

INCLUDE 'rules/common.rules'    # common rules for all hosts
}}}



3) copy eddie/config.sample/message.rules and eddie/config.sample/common.rules

to eddie/config/



4) edit common.rules and go down to "COMMON DIRECTIVES"



comment or remove all lines below, except for / add in these lines:

{{{

FS root:

    fs='/'

    rule='pctused >= 90'

    action=COMMONALERT(commonmsg.fs,1)

    act2ok=COMMONFIXED(commonmsg.fs,0)



FILE passwd:

    file='/etc/passwd'

    rule='md5 != lastmd5'

    scanperiod='1h'

    action=email(ALERT_EMAIL,"%(file)s has changed")

}}}



5) Ready to start checking!

priv/sudo/as root run eddie/bin/eddie.py &



check /var/log/eddie/log for errors
